# A TCP Client-Server written with go #

This project is made as a course work for subject "Distributed services and cloud technologies".

# Installation #

First clone the repo using:

  `$ git clone github.com/YuliiaKuzmyn/rpc-client-server.git`

Next you can build client/server with usual `go build`:

  `$ go build client/client.go`
    
Note: The usual `go get` command won't install this project as it has two main packages for both client and server.

# Usage #

After building `client` and `server` executables you can simply run them with:

`./client` and `./server` or alternatively with `go run client.go` without building at all

After that just follow help instructions inside the client and enjoy!
